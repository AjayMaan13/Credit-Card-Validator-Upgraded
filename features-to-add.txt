1.Interactive Menu System
An interactive menu allows users to select different options, like checking card validity, adding a new card, viewing history, or exiting. Here’s how to implement it:


2. Use of External APIs (BIN Database)  --- DONE

3.  Basic Encryption for Card Information  --- DONE


4. ncurses
For making a command-line UI (interactive menus, colored boxes, etc.).

Turns a plain terminal app into an interactive dashboard.
Demonstrates UI/UX thinking even in low-level code.


5. cJSON / JSON-C ---- DONE

✅ Impresses because:

Real-world apps almost always use JSON.
Recruiters know it’s painful in C, so if you do it well — big points.
📦 Install:

sudo apt install libcjson-dev
📡 Bonus: Integrate Logging with syslog.h
Use built-in syslog library to write event logs like:

When cards are added/checked.
When invalid card attempts are made.
✅ Recruiter-friendly because:

It mimics real-world app diagnostics.
Helps demonstrate log management skills.


6. Quick Sharing of Card Summary (Secure) -- DONE

7. qr generater





#FUTURE CHANGES

1. Integration with Future Web Dashboard / website
2. chart.js web dashboard that shows qr code + a real time looking card with details

That's a great mindset — turning a simple academic/co-op project into **a meaningful real-world tool** is exactly what stands out to employers and shows initiative. Your project is already pretty solid as a **credit card utility tool**. To give it **real purpose and practical impact**, you can evolve it into a **secure and helpful card management CLI app**.

Here are some **features and directions** you can add to make the project meaningful and outcome-driven:

---

### 💳 **Project Purpose Redefined**
> “A secure, terminal-based credit card management and validation utility for individuals and small businesses to store, validate, and track cards, encrypted locally.”

---

### 🔐 1. **Encryption Upgrade + Password Protection**
- **Add master password** to access/view saved cards.
- Encrypt the entire `cards.json` on disk using AES.
- Ask for the password on app start and decrypt in memory only.

✅ *Why?* — Makes it useful as a real-world **secure wallet for personal card storage.**

---

### 🌐 2. **Card Activity Logging**
- Add a timestamp whenever a card is added or viewed.
- Store logs in a secure encrypted log file.
- Include who added the card (optional: add user accounts).

✅ *Why?* — Now it's an **audit-tracking tool**—great for personal use or small teams.

---

### 💰 3. **Card Expiry Notifier**
- Show cards expiring in the next 3 months with a ⚠️ warning.
- Optional: Allow exporting expiring cards to a text/CSV report.

✅ *Why?* — Very useful for people managing multiple cards—**saves money and time.**

---

### 📤 4. **Export Card Data**
- Add options to export saved card details (mask number like `**** **** **** 0014`) to:
  - PDF (use `libharu` or similar)
  - CSV/Excel for business use
- Use a "consent" flag before exporting.

✅ *Why?* — Makes it practical for **admin tools or backups**.

---

### 📱 5. **Make It Cross-Platform + TUI**
- Add **TUI (Text User Interface)** using `ncurses` or `termbox`.
- Wrap in a **Dockerfile** so others can run securely on any OS.

✅ *Why?* — It looks professional, portable, and more accessible.

---

### 📡 6. **Extended API Integration**
- Add support to fetch:
  - Card issuer logo or bank info
  - Currency or country from BIN (via public APIs)
- Rate limit and fallback handling.

✅ *Why?* — Transforms it into an **educational tool + real-world bank utility**.

---

### 📂 7. **Multi-user & Roles**
- Add simple user auth system (username + password)
- Only certain users can add/delete/view cards
- Encrypt each user’s card file separately

✅ *Why?* — Now it’s suitable for **teams or shared environments**.

---

### 📋 8. **Command-Line Flags for Automation**
- Allow running tasks like `./main --list-expiring` or `--export`
- Combine with cron for scheduled reports

✅ *Why?* — Turns it into a **powerful tool for sysadmins and businesses**.
